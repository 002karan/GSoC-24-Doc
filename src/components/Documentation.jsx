        desc1="Hello there, I welcome you to come along with me on this journey of self-realisation, Demotivation, hardwork and self-confidence. In my freshman year at college, I had zero knowledge about Programming or how things work on the other side of the computer screen. One of my seniors then Introduced us to a program run by google - The Google Summer of Code. All I had grasped from that conversation was that to clear GSoC, one has to be very very good at coding, and Once you get selected, everyone will look upto you with immense respect (plus it pays really well). So, after thinking over it for some good amount of time (days maybe) I decided to finally..... quit the idea of clearing GSoC."

        desc2="Fast Forward to my 3rd year of college, Till this point I had experimented (did not become expert, but learned how to work with) with C++, Python and JavaScript. I realised that frontend development became my hobby. I really found it interesting to achieve that 100% perfection by changing colors for minutes (sometimes hours, sometimes). At around October 2023, I thought of reviving that old dream of getting selected to GSoC. Practically analysing my capabilities, I thought of trying to clear in 2024, but mainly in 2025. So, this started my journey of open source contributions. My first Pull Request on github got merged on October 7, 2023. I was overjoyed. After that, I made a <GSoC NoteBook> and started grabbing info about the program and strategies to get selected. I watched every video on GSoC available on youtube. Multiple times. I just wanted to not leave any room for mistake from my side."

        desc3="After shortlisting some orgs depending on my tech stack, I continued to contribute in various projects reading their big big codebases. Finally, I selected 1-2 final project under orgs Creative Commons and Internet Health Report. I liked the main idea behind both of these organisations. The project with Creative Commons was made final as I knew about the organisation about 5 years ago and liked the idea of sharing od Open Knowledge. While contributing to Creative Commons, I made sure I am Communicating enough with the mentors and also my fellow contributors. One thing was clear with me since the start : ITS ABOUT COLLABORATION, NOT COMPETITION. When the period to submit applications was near, I started making a draft of my application to get it reviewed by my mentor early. This was the most crucial aspect of my application- The Proposal pdf. I gave all my efforts into making this, with 7 days and sleepless nights, did not focus on any other activity at this time. After my proposal was ready, I was among the first guys to have their first draft of proposal ready. I did not send any incomplete proposal for review, I made sure my mentor does not have to work too hard to review it, So I made it as much detailed and good as I could. After some 2 or 3 rounds of suggestions by my mentor, I submitted the proposal. Even after submitting the proposal and while waiting for the results to come out, I did not leave the organisation. I tried to contribute and was actively looking at the github repository."

        desc4="At this point, I had gave most of my previous 6 to 7 months to GSoC. Moreover I became emotionally attached to it because It seemed to me like an opportunity to begin respecting myself again (in terms of studies and career) as in college I somewhat lagged behind my peers in academics due to the new shift from school to college. I was not able to figure it out like others, about what to pursue in the longer run. So yes, clearing GSoC became a very big deal for me, both emotionally and professionally. I informed my close friends about it, and was very nervous about the results. But, here comes one more task that I gave myself, to not get very depressed If I do not get selected, as I will not be having enough time to get sad. My internships season was on its way in 3-4 months and I had to do something this year to get that lost confidence back. With all these thoughts in mind, I waited for the final day of result. Some hindi (my mother tongue) phrases I used to say to myself - (Kaash ho jaaye GSoC) (Agar nahi bhi hua toh sambhaalna hai khudko) (Ho gaya toh sabse pehle mammi papa ko bataunga) (Chances toh hain hone ke, theek theek mehnat toh ki hai dekhte hain) (Agar ho gaya, toh acchhe se kaam karna hai). It became a really big deal for me."

        desc1="After waiting for nearly 20 days, On May 1, 1800 UTC I recieved an Email from <summerofcode.google.com> which had the Subject line - GSoC 2024: Congratulations! your proposal with Creative Commons has been accepted."

        desc2="I sat on the bed in my hostel room, and just reminisced all the moments in the previous 7 months. Those moments of self doubt, self motivation and what not. One of my friend was with me, He was also very happy about my selection but chose to keep calm. I called my parents and was just giggling in happiness all the time. For the first time in my college life, I had a big achievement to make them happy (In context with studies and career). So this was the story till my selection to Google Summer of Code, will try to not get emotional (and be professional) while writing further chapters."

        desc3="PRO TIPS: (1) Start as early as possible (depending on your familiarity with open source). (2) If you couldn't start early, do work hard. By early I mean 7-8 months prior to application, If you are a complete beginner. (3) Start with the website repository of an organisation to sart solving easier issues first. (4) Have self confidence. (5) The most important, Be CONSISTENT."
