## THE PROJECT I AM WORKING ON 

<div align="left">

Creative Commons has been advocating for the Open Sharing of knowledge for years, standardizing the process of granting permissions to use someone's work legally. The [CC Resource Archive](https://resources.creativecommons.org/) is the home to various resources about Creative Commons submitted by people all over the world.

The project - ***Modernize CC Resource Archive*** focuses on implementing a comprehensive  visual overhaul to the Resource Archive to align with current Creative Commons aesthetics and functionality standards. Utilizing the Internal Design System (Vocabulary), the project aims to upgrade the visual design, implement semantic, accessible, and standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and improve user experience (UX) for resource submission while ensuring site stability on GitHub Pages. Through these efforts and solid documentation, the revamped Resources Archive will meet modern standards, enhance usability, and facilitate maintainability for both users and developers.

## OVERALL IMPACT

<div align="left">

The project's main focus is not just to improve the User Interface of the *Resource Archive* but also making it more accessibile and maintainable. At the completion of the project, the Resource Archive site will be at par with other Creative Commons sites, and follow the same design scheme. This will enhance the user experience with enhancements/addition of various functionalities.

## CONTRIBUTIONS AND WORK

<div align="left">

Throughout the program timeline, the following tasks were executed/merged. As the project involved major changes in user interface, many PRs are based on CSS and JavaScript code. The resource archive is built on Jekyll as static pages, deployed with Github Pages. The local development setup is most preferably done with Docker.

- ### Development Environment Optimisation and Setup - PRs [#266](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/266), [#268](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/268) and [#279](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/279)
  With help from mentors and thorough testing, we were able to optimise the developemnt environment, update the `docker-compose.yml` file to the current spec, and made sure the local development experience remains seamless.
  
- ### Improving File Structure - PRs [#280](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/280), [#281](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/281), [#282](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/282), [#289](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/289), [#292](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/292) and  [#296](https://github.com/creativecommons/cc-resource-archive/pull/296)
  With discussion with my mentor, I improved the file structure in the codebase for better understandability and maintainability. After updating the structure, the paths to all the files that were changed were modified.  This was achieved by a group of Pull Requests that were created catering to the issue.
